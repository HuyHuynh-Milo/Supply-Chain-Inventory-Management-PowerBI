# Supply-Chain-Inventory-Management-PowerBI
üè≠This project was created to fulfill the needs of inventory management: keep track of the storage quantity, value, as well as fully control inventory status such as stockout, excess stock. The Dashboard performs in Power BI application with many usage of DAX and Power Query, BigQuery, and SQL are also used to query the dataset.

## üìù 1. Background & Overview
üìå **a. Problem Statement**
Businesses often struggle to maintain optimal inventory levels due to a lack of visibility into stock movements, valuation, and future demand. Inefficient inventory tracking can lead to overstock, stockouts, and inaccurate financial reporting. This project aims to develop an Inventory Tracking System that provides real-time insights into:
- Stock quantity, inventory value, and total items remaining
- Fully control of Stock status like stockout, atstock, excessstock, and below-safety stock
- Forecast future stock and day to stockout each item
- Understand the excess and missing-stock value.
- Helping businesses make data-driven decisions to improve supply chain efficiency and reduce costs.

üèπ **b. Who is this project for**
- Supply chain managers, inventory planners, and business analysts who need to monitor stock performance.
- Businesses seeking a data-driven approach to track inventory value, identify slow-moving items.

## üìÇ 2. Dataset Description & Data Structure
### üóÉÔ∏è Raw Dataset
- This is a dataset of an imaginary e-commerce company named *Adventure Works*, they sells bicycles and things related to sport.
- The dataset is in the Google Cloud Service. To get the data, use *Google BigQuery*. Check for it:
  - [BigQuery Plaform](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/sandbox)
- This is a very massive dataset with several tables containing information about sales, customers, employees, manufacutures, etc. Connect to each other using ***keys***.
- An exemple for the dataset conection:

- But for this project, I'll have some steps to extract, transform, and load the dataset to get the necessary information only.
- 5 tables: **Product, Inventory, Category, WorkOrder, and SaleOrder** are the main tables that will be used for this report.

### üì© Get Data
- To synthesize 5 tables i mentioned before, some SQL functions  will be used on the Google BigQuery
```SQL
# Query Product Table
SELECT ProductID, Name, 
       SafetyStockLevel,
       ReorderPoint, StandardCost, 
       DaysToManufacture, FinishedGoodsFlag,
       ProductSubcategoryID
FROM `adventureworks2019.Production.Product`
;

# Query Category Table 
SELECT 
       ps.ProductSubcategoryID, 
       ps.Name AS Subcategory,
       ps.ProductCategoryID,
       pc.Name AS Category
From `adventureworks2019.Production.ProductSubcategory` AS ps
JOIN `adventureworks2019.Production.ProductCategory` AS pc 
ON ps.ProductCategoryID = pc.ProductCategoryID
;

# Query WorkOrder Table
SELECT ProductID, WorkOrderID, 
       OrderQty, StartDate, 
       EndDate, DueDate
FROM `adventureworks2019.Production.WorkOrder`
;

# Query Inventory Table
SELECT pi.ProductID,
       pi.LocationID,
       pi.Quantity,
       pl.Name AS Location,
       pi.ModifiedDate 
FROM `adventureworks2019.Production.ProductInventory` AS pi 
JOIN `adventureworks2019.Production.Location` AS pl 
ON pi.LocationID = pl.LocationID
;

# Query SaleOrder Table
SELECT sd.SalesOrderDetailID,
       sh.SalesOrderID,
       sh.OrderDate,
       sh.SubTotal AS SubTotal_Order,
       sd.ProductID,
       sd.OrderQty,
       sd.UnitPrice,
       sd.LineTotal AS LineTotal_Product
FROM `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderHeader` AS sh
JOIN `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderDetail` AS sd
ON sh.SalesOrderID = sd.SalesOrderID
ORDER BY sd.SalesOrderDetailID
;
```

## 3. Main process in Power BI
### 1. ‚öíÔ∏è Preprocessing Data
**a. Dataset & Preprocessing explanation**
- This dataset doesn't have the stock quantity during the time period, so i'll hypothesize that the dataset ends its record on 31-May and the calculations like Stock Quantity, Value, Status,... are at that time.
- Every calculation after the end of May (like work order) is my Forecast for future demand.

**b. Inventory Turnover**
- The Inventory Turnover is gonna be calculated by approximation (due to the lack of stock quantity for the time period):

  <img width="427" height="77" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6ce4999-a075-4fe5-82fd-fd66ddd039a0" />
  
```DAX
InventoryTurnOver = 
VAR COGS = CALCULATE(
    SUMX(SaleOrder, SaleOrder[OrderQty]*RELATED('Product'[StandardCost])),
    FILTER(SaleOrder,SaleOrder[OrderDate] >= DATE(2013,6,1) && 
           SaleOrder[OrderDate]  < DATE(2014,6,1))
    )
RETURN DIVIDE(COGS,[InventValue])
```

**c. Stock Status**
- At Stock is the range of item quantity from Safety Stock -> SafetyStock * 1.3
- Excess-Stock is everything above the Maximum At-Stock
- Below safety are everything below the safety point.
- DAX code for stock status:
```DAX
StockStatus = 
    SWITCH(
        TRUE(),
        Inventory[Quantity] = 0, "Out Stock",
        Inventory[Quantity] < RELATED('Product'[SafetyStockLevel]), "Below Safety",
        Inventory[Quantity] <= RELATED('Product'[SafetyStockLevel])*1.3, "At Stock",
        "Over Stock"
        )
```
**d. Table Connection**
- I create a calendar table for datetime calculation and a Forecast Calendar for forecasting future inventory.
